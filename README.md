# testingagain

So a few months back i accidently hid one of the icons in the activity bar and it was the icon to push your code to git hub and i spent many hours on trying to get it back, this really put a hold on my coding, but now i found out how to get the icon back (You just had to right click over the activity bar SMH) But now ill be coding more!!
